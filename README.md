# TypeScript Type Error: 'string[]' is not assignable to type 'string'

This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error: passing an array of strings to a function expecting a single string.  The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.ts` provides a corrected version.  The error arises from a type mismatch between the function's parameter and the argument provided.
